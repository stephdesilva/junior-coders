Scratch projects for little coders
This repository houses projects designed for little coders. Currently, I'm teaching a code club in rural Australia using the Code Club Organisation's materials. They're designed for kids 9-12 and they are GREAT.

Due to our distance from the nearest town and the transport issues some of our families face, we offer code club to kids ages 5-12 here. Our little kids- we call them "red team"- find the more complex projects distributed by Code Club overwhelming. The reason for that is quite simple: they're designed for children much older than them!

This repository houses some simpler projects for use with our younger kids. You can find more information here:  http://rex-analytics.com/tiny-coders/
